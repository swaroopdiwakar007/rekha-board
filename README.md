## Why Rekha?

*Rekha* (रेखा) means **"line"** in Hindi, Marathi, Bengali and Gujarati, and it's the first thing you draw on a whiteboard.

Most whiteboard tools treat Indian scripts as an afterthought: the menus are English-only, the handwriting fonts don't have the glyphs, and typing in your own script means installing a keyboard layout. Rekha is built the other way round:

- **The whole interface is translated.** Tool names, style options, menus and hints appear in the language you pick.
- **Every script gets its own handwriting-style font,** so your text sits naturally next to the sketchy shapes.
- **You can type phonetically on any keyboard.** Write `namaste` and get नमस्ते, with no input method to install.

The eight languages are India's most widely spoken (Census 2011), spoken by over 80% of Indians.

## ✏️ Draw

Rectangles, diamonds, ellipses, arrows, lines and a freehand pen, all rendered with a hand-drawn wobble by [rough.js](https://roughjs.com). Fill shapes with hatching, cross-hatching or solid colour, and choose how rough you want the lines: *architect*, *artist* or *cartoonist*.

## ⌨️ Type in your script, from any keyboard

Turn on **phonetic typing** in the style card and type in Roman letters. Each word is converted as you type, and Backspace removes one Roman letter at a time.

![Typing namaste duniyaa, vaNakkam ulagam, kannaDa kalike and salaam duniyaa, each converting into native script](docs/phonetic.gif)

| Script | You type | You get |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Devanagari (Hindi, Marathi) | `namaste` · `maraaThee` | नमस्ते · मराठी |
| Bengali | `namaskaar` | নমস্কার |
| Telugu | `telugu` | తెలుగు |
| Tamil | `vaNakkam` · `thamizh` | வணக்கம் · தமிழ் |
| Gujarati | `gujaraatee` | ગુજરાતી |
| Urdu | `salaam` · `kyaa` | سلام · کیا |
| Kannada | `kannaDa` · `bas^` | ಕನ್ನಡ · ಬಸ್ |

Prefer your own keyboard or IME? Untick phonetic typing and type normally. Pasted text is never converted.

## 🌐 Nine languages, one click

The **script ribbon** at the bottom switches the entire interface. Each language's button is written in its own script, and the app name changes with it: रेखा, রেখা, రేఖ, கோடு, રેખા, ریکھا, ರೇಖೆ.

### Right-to-left for Urdu

Choosing اردو mirrors the whole layout: the tool rail, style card and menus all move to the opposite side, and text is set in the Nastaliq-style Gulzar font.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swaroopdiwakar007/rekha-board.git
cd rekha-board
python -m http.server 5180
```

Open **http://localhost:5180**. Any static file server works (`npx serve`, VS Code Live Server, GitHub Pages…). Fonts and rough.js load from CDNs, so you'll need an internet connection.

## How it works

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`index.html`](index.html) | Page shell: canvas, tool rail, style card, script ribbon |
| [`styles.css`](styles.css) | Paper-and-ink theme, dark mode, RTL-aware layout (logical CSS properties) |
| [`app.js`](app.js) | Canvas engine: element model, hit-testing, selection and resize, history, persistence, PNG and SVG export |
| [`i18n.js`](i18n.js) | Translated UI strings, plus the table of scripts, fonts and line heights |
| [`translit.js`](translit.js) | Roman-to-Indic transliteration |

**The transliteration trick:** Unicode lays out the Brahmic scripts in parallel blocks, so क (U+0915), ক (U+0995), ક (U+0A95), க (U+0B95), క (U+0C15) and ಕ (U+0C95) sit at the same offset in their blocks. `translit.js` converts Roman input to Devanagari once and then shifts each code point into the target script's block. It then patches each script's gaps: Tamil merges aspirated and voiced consonants and uses an explicit pulli, Bengali has no separate व, and Dravidian scripts distinguish short and long e and o. Urdu is an abjad, so it has its own position-aware mapping in which short vowels drop out mid-word.

**Fonts:** [Kalam](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kalam) (Latin and Devanagari), the [Baloo 2](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baloo+2) family (Bengali, Telugu, Tamil, Gujarati, Kannada) and [Gulzar](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Gulzar) (Urdu), all from Google Fonts.
